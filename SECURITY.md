## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Never commit these sensitive variables to version control:

```bash
# Database & Authentication
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=***
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=***

# Payment Processing
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=***

# External Services
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=***
VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=***
```

### Content Security Policy
Strict CSP headers implemented to prevent XSS attacks:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https: data: blob:
```

### CORS Configuration
