# Trust Signals Implementation Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive trust signal system has been designed to build user confidence and reduce friction throughout the iPEC Coach Connect platform. The implementation includes 4 main categories of trust signals:

1. **Security & Privacy Trust Signals** - Data protection and encryption badges
2. **Coach Credibility Signals** - Verification badges and certification indicators  
3. **Platform Reliability Signals** - Social proof, testimonials, and success metrics
4. **Contextual Trust Messaging** - Smart microcopy that builds trust at key moments

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Authentication Page
```tsx
function AuthPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <div className="max-w-md w-full">
          <AuthForm />
          <AuthTrustSignals context="signup" variant="footer" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="hidden lg:block lg:w-1/2 bg-gray-50">
        <AuthTrustSignals context="signup" variant="sidebar" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Coach Profile with Trust Signals
```tsx
function CoachProfile({ coach }) {
  const trustMetrics = {
    verificationLevel: 'gold',
    badges: [
      { type: 'ipec', level: 'gold', verified: true },
      { type: 'background', verified: true },
      { type: 'elite', level: 'platinum', verified: true }
    ],
    stats: {
      totalSessions: 247,
      successRate: 96,
      responseTime: '< 1 hour',
      yearsExperience: 8
    }
  };

  return (
    <CoachProfileCard
      coach={{ ...coach, trustMetrics }}
      variant="detailed"
      showTrustSignals={true}
