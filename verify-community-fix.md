# Community Page UI Fix - Verification

## Problem Identified and Fixed

The community page UI was broken due to a **type mismatch in the `useAuthAwareActions` hook**. 

### Root Cause
In `/src/pages/community/EnhancedCommunity.tsx`, the component was trying to destructure a `profile` property from the `useAuthAwareActions` hook that didn't exist:

```typescript
// BROKEN CODE (before fix)
const { 
  isAuthenticated, 
  isLoading, 
  profile,          // ❌ This property doesn't exist in the hook
  primaryRole,
  canPerformAction 
} = useAuthAwareActions();
```

### Solution Applied
1. **Removed the `profile` from the destructuring** in `useAuthAwareActions`
2. **Added a separate call** to `useUnifiedUserStore` to get the profile data

```typescript
// FIXED CODE (after fix)
const { 
  isAuthenticated, 
  isLoading, 
  primaryRole,
  canPerformAction 
} = useAuthAwareActions();

const profile = useUnifiedUserStore(state => state.profile);
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/pages/community/EnhancedCommunity.tsx`**
   - Fixed the hook destructuring issue
   - Added proper profile data access

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
2. ✅ Build process completes successfully  
3. ✅ Development server starts without issues
4. ✅ Component imports resolve correctly
5. ✅ No runtime errors in browser console

## Test Results

- **TypeScript Check**: No errors
- **Build Process**: Successful
- **Import Resolution**: All imports working correctly
- **Authentication Components**: Properly integrated

## Community Page Features Working

✅ **Authentication-aware components** - AuthAwareWrapper, AuthPrompt, ConditionalAction
✅ **Progressive content disclosure** - Content adapts based on auth state
✅ **Role-based rendering** - Different content for different user types
✅ **Enhanced UI components** - Cards, buttons, badges, avatars
✅ **Animation and interactions** - Framer Motion animations working
